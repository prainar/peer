# Day 9: Feed Interactions

## 🎯 Goal

Enhance the feed with interactive features, real-time updates, and engaging user interactions.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

* Implement post interaction features (like, comment, share).
* Set up real-time updates using WebSocket.
* Create interactive animations and feedback.
* Handle real-time data synchronization.
* Implement user engagement features.
* Build responsive interaction patterns.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Ensure your Day 8 Basic Feed is complete and tested. You should understand React components, state management, and basic WebSocket concepts. The backend and frontend should be set up and running.

## 🛠️ Tasks

1.  **Create and Switch to a New Branch**
    > **IMPORTANT:** Always create a new branch for each distinct piece of work.

    ```bash
    # First, ensure you are on your 'main' branch and it's up-to-date
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main # Get any potential updates from your own fork's main

    # Now, create and switch to a new branch for this day's assignment/feature
    git checkout -b day-9-feed-interactions
    ```

    > **What's happening?** You're creating an independent line of development for this day's tasks.

2.  **Set Up Development Environment**
    * **Backend Virtual Environment (if not already active):**
        ```bash
        cd backend
        source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **Install Additional Dependencies:**
        ```bash
        pip install Flask-SocketIO python-socketio
        ```
    * **Frontend (already set up from previous days):**
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        npm install socket.io-client
        ```

3.  **Interactive Features Implementation (Frontend & Backend)**
    * **Create Interaction Components:**
        * Implement like/unlike functionality directly on post cards.
        * Create a basic comment system allowing users to add comments to posts.
        * Add options to share posts (e.g., placeholder share functionality).
        * (Optional for this tutorial) Implement a bookmark feature.
        * Create interaction animations for likes, comments, etc. to provide visual feedback.
    * **Set Up Real-time Updates:**
        * Implement a WebSocket connection from the frontend to the Flask backend.
        * Create real-time event handlers on both frontend and backend for interactions.
        * Set up live updates for likes, so other users see changes instantly.
        * Implement live comment updates for a dynamic conversation experience.
        * (Optional for this tutorial) Add a basic notification system for new interactions.

4.  **User Experience Enhancement (Frontend)**
    * **Implement Interactive Feedback:**
        * Add success and error messages for interaction actions (e.g., "Post liked!", "Failed to comment").
        * Create loading states for interactions (e.g., a spinner when submitting a comment).
        * (Optional for this tutorial) Implement undo actions for quick corrections.
        * Add interaction animations to make the UI more engaging.
        * Create smooth transitions between different interaction states.
    * **Optimize Real-time Performance:**
        * Implement robust WebSocket connection handling, including connection status indicators.
        * Add automatic reconnection logic for WebSocket connections.
        * Create fallback mechanisms for real-time features if WebSocket connection fails.
        * Optimize update frequency to balance real-time feel with performance.
        * Consider handling offline scenarios for interactions (e.g., queuing actions).

5.  **Run the Application**

    ```bash
    # Start the backend server (in one terminal)
    cd backend
    flask run

    # Start the frontend development server (in another terminal)
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application will be available at:

    -   Frontend: `http://localhost:3000/feed`
    -   Backend API: `http://localhost:5000`
    -   WebSocket: `ws://localhost:5000`

6.  **Testing**

    * Test all interaction features (like, comment, share) for functionality.
    * Test real-time updates for likes and comments across multiple browser windows/users.
    * Test WebSocket connection and reconnection behavior.
    * Test offline behavior (if implemented).
    * Test performance and responsiveness of the interactive feed.

## 🔄 Git Workflow

1.  **Develop and Save Progress**

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Day 9: Implement feed interactions and real-time updates"
    ```

2.  **Push Your Changes to Your Fork**

    ```bash
    git push -u origin day-9-feed-interactions
    ```

3.  **Merge After Completion**

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    git merge day-9-feed-interactions
    git push origin main
    ```
